PreK & K
Skills developed at this stage of a child’s education set the foundation for everything that comes after. ISL has carefully designed a curriculum that encourages education through play-based discovery and problem solving. Focusing on emulation, imagination, and experience. Our students are introduced to team-work, cooperation, communication, and exploration. 
Social skills play an important role in the early stages of childhood and education. ISL uses programs that are based upon emotional intelligence and personal development. 
Students are taught.

Lower Primary 
Students at this stage of their educational journey are now ready to ‘learn how to learn’. In that they are socially and emotionally prepared to understand concepts in greater depth than in PreK and K. They understand cause and effect, and are ready to meet the expectations of goal-setting, and using concept-based units with a focus on Social and Emotional Learning, Technology, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging. By integrating these content standards and empowering students to build their confidence in a supported learning environment our students excel in concepts earlier than what is typically achieved in schools using older methodologies of teaching. ISL has developed effective teaching models to ensure student engagement, progress and attainment. ISL students are excited to learn and take responsibility for their own learning. 

Upper Primary (Middle School)
Skills developed by students through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) developed in specific units of inquiry at ISL from Grade 4+ will provide them with the foundation to succeed at school and beyond.
Entrepreneurial education is about developing our students’ ability to create social, cultural, or economic value. Enabling experiences for thinking critically and creatively. All of which enables experiences for thinking critically and creatively, undertaking complex problem solving, negotiation, and leadership skills which contribute to developing a student’s entrepreneurial mindset which will stay with them throughout their lives. 

High School  
Now is when our students are expected to shine, and put all of the ‘stepping-stones’ together to build the staircase that will ultimately lead them to their highest goals! Our rigorous academic standards are aligned with and built upon objectives to surpass the typical standard of education in Lubumbashi, and indeed in the DRC. At ISL 75%+ of our students;
	•	Demonstrate levels of knowledge, skills, understanding, and progress that exceeds curriculum provided at other schools. 
Our students understand their unique strengths and weaknesses and act purposefully to improve, by actively, and purposefully collaborating with their peers and teachers alike to engage in a range of productive learning situations. Our students are consistently provided specific levels of challenge and support. ISL teachers are highly educated and trained in the complexities and knowledge of their area of specialization. They engage in relevant learning themes and deep-thinking investigations, which prepare our students for 21st century living and engage them in learning with enjoyment and passion.
